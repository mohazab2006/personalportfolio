    - [ ] Project descriptions and details
    - [ ] Skills/Tech Stack descriptions (if any)
    - [ ] Meta descriptions (SEO)

**Files to review:**

- Component files if they contain hardcoded text

---

---

## 💡 Future Improvements (Optional)

### Contact Form
- [ ] Create contact form component with validation
- [ ] Integrate email service (EmailJS or Resend)
- [ ] Add to Contact section

**Implementation ideas:**
- Simple form with name, email, message
- EmailJS for free email sending
- Or just use a mailto link (easiest)

---

### Certificates Section
- [ ] Decide on implementation approach
- [ ] Add certificates data to `lib/data.ts`
- [ ] Build UI component
- [ ] Integrate into portfolio

**Implementation ideas:**

**Option A: Toggle with Experience section**
- Add toggle button: "Experience" | "Certificates"
- Reuse timeline/card layout
- Shows one or the other

**Option B: Toggle with Tech Stack section**
- Button to switch: "Tech Stack" | "Certificates"  
- Same section space, different content
- Keeps page length shorter

**Option C: Separate section**
- New dedicated "Certificates & Awards" section
- After Education or Experience
- Most prominent, but adds page length

**Recommendation:** Option B (toggle with tech stack) keeps the page concise while showcasing both skills and credentials.

---

### Tech Stack Section Redesign
- [ ] Redesign tech stack visual layout

**Current state:** Basic grid with percentage bars (in data.ts but not displayed?)

**Ideas for improvement:**
- Card-based layout with icons
- Animated skill bars with hover effects
- Tech logos instead of just text
- Group by category with better visual hierarchy
- Interactive hover states showing experience level
- Badge/pill design instead of bars

---

### DevPost Integration
- [ ] Add DevPost to PERSONAL data in `lib/data.ts`
- [ ] Add DevPost to siteConfig links in `lib/seo.ts`
- [ ] Update SocialRail component to display DevPost icon
- [ ] Add DevPost to generatePersonSchema for SEO

**Implementation:**
- Add `devpost: 'https://devpost.com/yourhandle'` to PERSONAL object
- Include in siteConfig.links
- Use 🏆 or appropriate icon in SocialRail
